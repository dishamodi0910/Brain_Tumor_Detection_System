# Brain Tumor Detection System
Brain tumor detection system is built using the convolutional neural network architecture where around 1000 images are considered for dataset. The model is trained to detect from MRI image whether the person is having tumor or not.

### Concepts included : 
- Creating Sequential Model
- Splitting Dataset
- Image Processing
  - MaxPooling
  - DropOut
  - Flattening
- Model Creation
- Model Evaluation(Metrics)
- Saving a Model
